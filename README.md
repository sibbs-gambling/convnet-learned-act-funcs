# CNN on CIFAR-10 Image Dataset

### Intro
I am implementing learned activation function CNN ala Agostinelli & Hoffman (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6830.pdf) 
on a GPU. __Goal__ is to get approximately 92% - 95% classification rate without taking longer than 5 minutes.

### Data
I use the classic CIFAR-10 set of images taken from: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.
